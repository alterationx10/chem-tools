These are tools that might be useful to a computational chemist,
especially one doing spectroscopy related things.

All of my programs are designed to give helpful tips/reminders 
about using them if run without any arguments (or at least I try for that)

boltzman.f
----------
Generates the Boltzmann distribution on a set of N different conformers at a specified Temperature
*Temperature in Kelvin
*Energy in kJ/mol
*Lowest conformer energy has to be (pre)set at 0

cnc.f
-----
Generates the XYZ coordinates of the Center of Nuclear Charge. It uses a standard XYZ file as an argument
*Works on elements 1-99
*Elements are case sensitive, i.e. He not he or HE

mv2cnc.f
-----
Same as cnc.f, but outputs an centered XYZ file "centered.xyz" (translation only, no rotation.
*Works on elements 1-99
*Elements are case sensitive, i.e. He not he or HE

z-rotate
--------
I don't remember what this does, but I'm guessing it rotates an XYZ structure about the Z (0,0,1) axis.
*???

ligand.f
--------
Designed to take a lone bipy/phen ligand, calculate a normalized vector based upon the position of the 2 nitrogen atoms,
translate all the atoms a certain distance along that vector, and rotate the compound a number of degree about that vector.
*Distance in whatever units your XYZ is in
*Amount of rotation should be given in Degrees

sos.f90
-------
Calculates a Sum Over States for a CD calculation
*???

rot2zero.f90
------------
Calculates the running sum pf the rotatory strengths from a CD calculation.
*???

antisymeterized-lorentzian-generator.f
--------------------------------------
Generates a linear combination of antisymmeterized Lorentzian 
functions and its corresponding Hilbert transform pair

lorentzian-generator.f
--------------------------------------
Generates a linear combination of Lorentzian functions and its corresponding Hilbert transform pair
